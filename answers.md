# Part 1

## Set 1
1. The bug stays in a constant pattern moving around the grid. 
2. The direction that its head is pointing at is where it moves 
3. The bug rotates if it isn't moving
4. The bug leaves flowers behind
5. Rotates 90 degrees when the bug hits the wall
6. When a bug is going towards a rock, the bug will rotate 45 degrees and checks to see if there is a rock. If not, the bug then rotates another 45 degrees and goes forward toward the direction.  
7. The flower doesn't move
8. The flower changes color when a bug goes over it and turns darker as the bug goes further and further away. 
9. The Rocks can move but only if you use a certain method which is move and also change color
10. There can't be more than one figure in the grid because bugs and flowers can't.

### Exercises   
1. 0 : North
   45: North East  
   90: East  
   135: South East  
   180: South  
   225: South West  
   270: West
   315: North west
   360: North  
2. The moveTo method allows the bug to move in whatever direction but only if it is inside the bounds of the grid.
3.void setColor  
4. The bug is gone

# Part 2

## Set 2  

1. sideLength is the length of the box that BoxBug travels in  
2. steps tracks how many steps the boxbug moves so that it moves that specific amount  
3. It is called twice because it only turns the bug 45 degrees and in order to make a complete turn turn twice. 
4. Because the move function is inherited from the super class Bug.  
5. No you cannot change the square pattern as in there are no methods in which you change the variable sideLength so once the bug is constructed it cannot be changed!  
6. Obstacles in the path of the boxBug will cause it to change its path.  
7. Once you turn twice.  

### Exercises  
1.  CircleBug is different because it only turns once instead of twice which makes it move in a circular path instead of a square.Other than that it is very similiar.  

2. Spiral bug moves in a spiral and every single bug created is basically going to do what its name tell you.  
5. Check out the src code!    


# Part 3  

## Set 3  

1. loc1.getRow();  
2. false  
3.(3,5)    
4. South east  
5. You pass in the direction and the starting location, as the program translates the direction into coordinates, then it will execute and return the tile that has those transformations on the original.  

## Set 4    
1. Gets the count of objects in a grid by getting the size of the ArrayList for get occupied Location and get a count of the empty locations in a bounding grid by subtracting that number from the total number of grid spaces.  

2. the isValid() method  

3. The implementations would be found in the classes that use this interface  

4.No because ArrayLists are much more flexible for adjusting values in an array and can have adjusted values and different lengths based on the information passed to them.    

## Set 5 

1. Color, direction, location  
2. Default color is red and direction is north 
3. There are default methods for all actors and it wouldn't feasible to write all the methods within all the subclasses.
4. No and actor cannot be put onto a grid twice without removing itself and it can't remove itself twice. However it can be placed, remove itself and put back.
5. method turn() which will turn it 45 degrees, 2 turns is 90.  


## Set 6  
1. isValid() method to see if the place its moving to is on the grid.  
2.It checks to see if a space is empty or a flower which moves.  
3. isValid() and get() to check its moves  
4. getAdjacentLocation()  
5. getLocation()  
6. isValid() will return false and it will remove itself from the grid.  
7. It's not needed. 
8. Inherits the bugs color.  
9. No placing a flower is considered a move.  
10. flower.putSelfInGrid(gr, loc);  
11. 4 

## Group Questions:  

### 1.Specify  
a) It will move 1 space and jump over the rock or flower on the next jump.  
b) It will jump once and turn 90 degrees.  
c) Turn 90 degrees and resume jumping.
d) It will destroy the actor.  
e) Both destroyed.
f) No.    

### 2.Design  
a) Bug  
b) No 
c) Yes, the parameter should be grid
d) The act method should be overridden and  the constructor as well and canMove() and move()
e) A test for jumping such as canJump()
f) Creating a limited grid obstacle course for the bug involving other actors and obstacles.

### Code  
Done 

### Testing  
The jumper destroyed everything except the flowers and jumped 2 spots. Done.

# Part 4  

## Set 7  
1. act, getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocation, makeMove
2. getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocation, makeMove  
3. Yes, if the new critter subclass selects its actors from different locations than Critter class does, it will need to
override this method.  
4. use the processActors method, make and ArrayList of all their neighbors and process them,check the location that the Critter would move to and if that space is occupied don't move there.  
5. To make a critter move, getmoveLocations gets the locations that the critter can move to, selectMoveLocations selects the location for that critter to move to and makeMove() moves the critter.  
6. Critter extends Actor. The Actor class has a default constructor. If you do not create a constructor in a
class, Java will write a default constructor for you. The Critter default constructor that Java provides will call
super(), which calls the Actor default constructor. The Actor default constructor will make a blue critter
that faces north.    

## Set 8    
1. The act method calls getActors, processActors, getMoveLocations, selectMoveLocation,
and makeMove. The ChameleonCritter class overrides the processActors and makeMove
methods. Therefore, calling act for a ChameleonCritter will produce different behavior than calling act
for a Critter.  
2. The makeMove method of the ChameleonCritter first changes the direction of the critter to face its new
location. Then it calls super.makeMove of the Critter class to actually move to the new location. After it
changes its direction, it behaves like (makeMove like) a Critter.  
3.Add the code that makes Bug drops flowers into the Critter makeMove() methods, then adjust it for the Critter's specific properties.    
4. It doesn't getActors differently from Critter so it doesn't a new method.  
5. Actor   
6. getGrid() method    

## Set 9  
1. CrabCritter does inherit the processActors method from Critter because it did not override the method.  
2. The CrabCritterâ€™s getActors method only looks for neighbors that are immediately in front of the crab
critter and to its right-front and left-front locations.  
3. The parameter for this method brings in an array of directions. For the crab critter, this array contains the directions of
the possible neighbors that this crab can eat. The method getLocationsInDirections uses this array to
determine and return valid adjacent locations of this critter in the directions given by the array parameter.  
4. (4,3), (4,4), and (4,5) 
5. The crab moves right to left randomly and a Critter just moves randomly across the grid, in all directions.  
6. When it hits another actor, it turns.  
7. A crab critter inherits the processActors method from the Critter class. This method only removes actors
that are not rocks and not critters. Since a CrabCritter is a Critter, a crab critter will not eat any other
critter.
